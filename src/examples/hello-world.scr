-- The main function must have
-- the export keyword before it.
-- This tells the compiler to make it
-- visible outside of the current files
-- scope.

-- A proc that does not take any params
-- must have the keyword `void` in it.

-- The return type of the function
-- comes after `):`.
export proc main(void): i32 {
    printf("hello world\n"); -- call to C function printf
    return 0;
